ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Georgia Harris, a web developer with a passion for creating user-friendly, impactful digital experiences. 
I'm currently completing a Certificate of Applied Software Development at DevAcademy, where Iâ€™ve worked on several projects!
These include, but are not limited to:
  - Chatter: a pseudo social-media web app conducted as part of my final group project to create a platform where DevAcademy graduates can keep in contact!
  - Bookshelf: a more personalised, book review web app where users can share reviews and book recommendations with friends and family!
Overall, my repositories showcase a blend of creativity and technical skill, focusing on accessibility, collaboration, and problem-solving.
